# resume-template

This is a simple resume, cover letter, and references template made using LaTeX. It is a modified form of the template featured on LaTeXTemplates.com: http://www.latextemplates.com/template/medium-length-professional-cv. This repository features a custom LaTeX package used for creating resume and references entries, as well as a sample resume, coverletter, and reference page. 

The package makes use of the wasysm (for icons), mdwlist, and phonenumbers (for phone number formatting) packages, and the LaTeX files make use of the hyperref and helvet (for using Helvetica) packages, all of which can be found in https://www.ctan.org/.
